You will need the API token to run MapBox. Add a file .env in the root and past what I would give to you.

I used React Hooks as javascript library and MapBox as a third part api.

You can do:
-Search by name
-Search by location
-Search by name and location
-Add and remove hotels in your favorites

You have:
-A map for each hotel to see where is the hotel and the distance between you and the hotel
-A map in the HomePage that show hotels around you and their distances from you
-You can filter by km the range of hotels around you
